        <h2 class="fs24 ffs">About Carolina Eastern</h2>
        <p class="fs16 ffss">
          Since its beginning in 1972 , Carolina Eastern has been helping
          farmers grow their crops bigger and better every year. CEO Ashton
          Phillips founded Carolina Eastern along with partners Tony Cecil of
          Charleston and Sammie Rodgers of Scranton in 1972 amid uncertain times
          for the fertilizer industry. "We were able to survive and actually
          thrive during the early years because we were dedicated to hard work
          and to satisfying our customers." says CEO Phillips.
        </p>
        <p class="fs16 ffss">
          Today, Carolina Eastern employs over 300 people and operates more
          than 40 plants throughout the Southeast and beyond. With operations as
          far away as South Dakota and Minnesota, Carolina Eastern is dedicated
          to excellence through growth.
        </p>
        <p class="fs16 ffss">
          Two major principles stand out at Carolina Eastern: the importance of
          people and the commitment to manage change.
        </p>
        <p class="fs16 ffss">
          "People are the heart of our business,"' says CEO Phillips. "Without
          good people, it would be impossible to do what we do." As a family
          business owner, Phillips knows the importance of valuing people
          completely. "With our staff representing Carolina Eastern across the
          country, it is crucial to maintain positive relationships with them as
          they are the "real people"' that deal with the farmers day by day."'
          Farmers throughout the Southeast have grown to trust Carolina Eastern
          because of the reputation of the company and its senior
          management.
        </p>
        <p class="fs16 ffss">
          CEO Ashton Phillips and President Al Phillips have mastered the
          delicate skills of change management. "'The (fertilizer) industry is
          constantly changing. Farmers are becoming better businessmen and the
          farms are getting bigger," says Phillips.
        </p>
        <p class="fs16 ffss">
          "Change has been, and will continue to be, a major factor in the
          fertilizer business, and the degree that Carolina Eastern can react
          positively to it will determine the level of success we can achieve."
          says Mr. Phillips with an optimistic tone. The fertilizer business has
          changed over the years from large, port-based factories to smaller
          plants in farming communities. The smaller plants today not only
          analyze the farms soil in order to mix the proper fertilizer for that
          specific farm, but can also spread the fertilizer for the farmer.
        </p>
        <p class="fs16 ffss">
          Change has been more than a buzzword in the fertilizer industry. In
          the early 70s, the oil companies were major players and, throughout
          the years, big grain concerns have gone in and out of the fertilizer
          business. "Stick to what you know" says Phillips in a word of advice.
          With its recent development of a new home fertilizer, Vertago,
          Carolina Eastern is not hesitant to explore new opportunities.
          Operating as a wholesaler, distributor, retailer and service provider,
          Carolina Eastern has experienced the gamut of business
          development.
